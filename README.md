# Github Clone with Search Functionality

I livestreamed the creation of this app on my twitch account: [b1ueh4wk](https://www.twitch.tv/b1ueh4wk/).

Total time spent on project: 9 hours

## Material UI, Postman, and Exalidraw used

This project attempts to recreate the look of the Github website while giving it the functionality of a working search bar.

## How to run the project

Fork the repository

Copy the clone information

Open terminal or command line 

run git clone (and paste the copied information)

cd into the folder

run npm i

run npm start

You may use a web browser extension with your IDE to view this code locally!

## No test suite

## Future improvements
First and foremost add more features to the items that are pulled up from the search. Make each of the titles a link to the repository, and try to add the other icons and images. 

Second add a nav bar at the top and a footer at the bottom.

There is so much more that I could add from there, but that is about all I would do to this to finish it up. 

## Feedback on exercise

This was an excellent exercise! I have lots I need to improve on but it definitely challenged me to think critically under a time constraint.
