# Github Clone with Search Functionality

I livestreamed the creation of this app on my twitch account: [b1ueh4wk](https://www.twitch.tv/b1ueh4wk/).

Total time spent on project: 10 hours

## Material UI, React, Postman, and Exalidraw

This project attempts to recreate the look of the Github website while giving it the functionality of a working search bar.

Here is a picture of my basic wireframing.

## How to run the project

Open the repository at [GithubClone](https://github.com/MichaelJHTaggart/GithubClone)

Fork the repository

Copy the clone information (example shown below)

Open terminal or command line 

run git clone (and paste the copied information)

cd into the folder

run npm i

run npm start

You may use a web browser extension with your IDE to view this code locally!

## No test suite

## Future improvements
I would like to add more features to the search results.

Add a nav bar at the top and a footer at the bottom.

Obviously I could make this more than a one page application, but that is about all I would do with this clone.

## Feedback on exercise

This was an excellent exercise! I have lots I need to improve on but it definitely challenged me to think critically under a time constraint. It was great practice to get more used to Material UI. I would like to understand spacing a bit better with Material UI though. So much more to learn!
